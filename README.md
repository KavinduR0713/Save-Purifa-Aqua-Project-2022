# Save-Purifa-Aqua-Project-2022
Save Purifa Aqua Project 2022 is a data-driven initiative aimed at enhancing water quality through advanced data science techniques. The project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 6, which focuses on ensuring clean water and sanitation by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials. This initiative involves comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization to monitor and improve the water quality of various lakes, beginning with the Parliament Lake in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

## Objectives:
1. Identify water sources with the highest levels of pollution.
2. Collect and analyze water quality data from Parliament Lake.
3. Create an interactive dashboard to visualize the analyzed data.
4. Raise public awareness and engage relevant authorities through social media campaigns.
5. Promote the purification of polluted water resources for sustainable human consumption.

## Data Collection and Analysis:
- The project involves meticulous data collection from multiple locations around Parliament Lake. Key water quality parameters measured include pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, turbidity, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). These parameters are crucial indicators of water health and are analyzed to understand the extent of pollution and its potential impacts.

## Data Visualization Techniques:
- The core of Save Purifa Aqua Project 2022 is the creation of a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard using Microsoft PowerBI. The dashboard utilizes several advanced data visualization techniques to present the collected data effectively:

1. **Pie Charts:** These charts display the distribution of parameters such as electrical conductivity, sulphate, COD, and BOD across different locations in Parliament Lake. They help in understanding the proportion of each parameter and how it varies by location.
2. **Scatter Charts:** These charts illustrate the correlation between COD and BOD, providing insights into the relationship between these critical indicators of organic pollution.
3. **Stacked Bar Charts:** These visualize multiple water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, turbidity) simultaneously across different locations, allowing for a comprehensive comparison.
4. **Interactive Location Map:** An image map of Parliament Lake divided into eight locations, each represented by a unique laboratory ID, is included. Selecting an ID updates all the charts to reflect data specific to that location.

##  Social Media Campaign:
- To enhance public engagement and awareness, Save Purifa Aqua Project 2022 runs a robust social media campaign through Facebook and Instagram under the name "Save Purifa Aqua." The campaign includes:
   - Continuous sharing of informative content about water pollution and conservation.
   - An online exhibition titled "Clear Water-Clear Tomorrow," featuring contributions from school students, including videos, drawings, essays, articles, and posters. Participants receive badges as recognition for their involvement.

## Impact:

- **Public Awareness:** The visualized data on the dashboard educates the public about water quality issues in an accessible format, encouraging community participation in pollution reduction efforts.
- **Engagement:** Social media activities engage a broad audience, including school students and university undergraduates, fostering a culture of environmental stewardship.
- **Policy Influence:** By presenting clear and compelling data, the project aims to influence policymakers and authorities to take decisive actions toward improving water quality.

## Lessons Learned:

- **Collaboration:** Effective collaboration and communication with government officials and relevant authorities are crucial for project success.
- **Teamwork:** Working in a team enhances problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking skills.
- **Adaptability:** Being prepared with alternative plans ensures continuity and adaptability in project execution.

## Sustainability Plan:
- Save Purifa Aqua Project 2022 is designed for long-term impact. The project will be handed over to subsequent student batches for continuation. Future steps include:
   - Expanding the project to other polluted water resources in different districts.
   - Modifying and adding new parameters as needed.
   - Providing access to established social media platforms and databases.
   - Mentoring new participants to carry forward the projectâ€™s mission.

## Conclusion:
- Save Purifa Aqua Project 2022 exemplifies how data science can drive significant social impact. By combining rigorous data analysis with effective public engagement, the project not only addresses immediate water quality issues but also fosters a sustainable culture of environmental responsibility. Through continuous learning and adaptation, Save Purifa Aqua Project 2022 aspires to create cleaner and healthier water resources for future generations.
